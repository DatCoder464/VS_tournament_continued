# Thruster
Redstone-powered, upgradable thruster.

There are two variants. A small thruster and a "normal" thruster.

The thruster is only active when redstone powered. It can be upgraded by right-clicking on it with a thruster upgrade.

## Config
The maximum thruster tier is 4 for the normal thruster, and 2 for the small thruster.

The normal thruster has a force of 10000.0 N, which gets multiplied by the tier / level of the thruster.

The small thruster is 0.2x as powerful as the normal thruster => 2000.0 N

Thrusters shut off at a speed of 80.0 m/s
